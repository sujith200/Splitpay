# Splitpay
SplitPay is a hybrid payment method for India’s e-commerce, letting users split payments—part online, part cash on delivery (e.g., ₹80 online + ₹500 COD). It reduces cart abandonment, boosts order completion, and suits food/grocery apps. Simple, scalable, and built for India’s unique payment landscape.
